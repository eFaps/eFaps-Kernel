/**
 * Class from this package should be only used if no J2EE server is used to
 * initialize the database connection and store binding. E.g. if a shell is
 * implemented, the shell does not have a J2EE server...
 *
 * To define the database connection, three naming bindings must exists:
 * <dl>
 *   <dt>{@link INamingBinds#RESOURCE_DBTYPE}</dt>
 *   <dd>Holds the instance of the Database Type. The implementing class must
 *       be derived from {@link org.efaps.db.databses.AbstractDatabase}.</dd>
 *   <dt>{@link INamingBinds#RESOURCE_DATASOURCE}<dt>
 *   <dd>Holds the instance of the SQL data source. The class must implement
 *       interface {@link javax.sql.DataSource}.</dd>
 *   <dt>{@link INamingBinds#RESOURCE_TRANSMANAG}</dt>
 *   <dd>Holds the instance of the Transaction Manager. The class must
 *       implement interface {@link javax.transaction.TransactionManager}.</dd>
