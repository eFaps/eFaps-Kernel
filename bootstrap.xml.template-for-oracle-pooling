  <comment>This is the bootstrap to connect to an eFaps database</comment>

  <!--
    This property configures the database type. The value is a name of a class
    derived from org.efaps.db.database.AbstractDatabase. Currently, two class
    names could be used:
      - org.efaps.db.databases.DerbyDatabase
      - org.efaps.db.databases.OracleDatabase
      - org.efaps.db.databases.PostgreSQLDatabase
    The information is needed to implement the vendor specific database
    functionality (e.g. a delete of all or table column types).
  -->
  <entry key="dbType">org.efaps.db.databases.OracleDatabase</entry>

  <!--
    Defines the instance which implemtents java.sql.DataSource. This class is
    defined for the oracle pooling.
  -->
  <entry key="dsClass">oracle.jdbc.pool.OracleDataSource</entry>

  <!--
    Database JDBC parameters:
    - database user name
    - database password
    - JDBC driver class name
    - JDBC url

  <entry key="userName">EFAPS</entry>
  <entry key="passWord">EFAPS</entry>

  <!--
    To create new sql data source, the oracle data source factory is used (this
    means also the the passWord, userName property and dsClass property must be
    defined).

  <entry key="maxWait">-1</entry>

  <!--
    To configure a DBCP DataSource so that abandoned dB connections are
    removed and recycled add the following paramater to the ResourceParams
    configuration for your DBCP DataSource Resource:
  -->
  <entry key="removeAbandoned">true</entry>

  <!--
    The logAbandoned parameter can be set to true if you want DBCP to log a
    stack trace of the code which abandoned the dB connection resources.
  -->
  <entry key="logAbandoned">true</entry>
